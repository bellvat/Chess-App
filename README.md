# Team Awesome! Chess Application  - Agile Team Development

Play it for yourself at https://chessapp-team-awesome.herokuapp.com/!

This is a fully functional two-player chess application built as a capstone project for The Firehose Project full-stack development program. Under the guidance of a senior software engineer, we had weekly Agile team meetings for code reviews, sprint planning, and feature assignments. Users are able to create accounts and play games against each other.

The following tools were used to create this application:

Ruby on Rails
Bootstrap framework
PostgreSQL database
Heroku hosting
RSpec test driven development
AJAX requests
jQuery for drag and drop functionality
Firebase for real-time updates and chat feature
